# Data-Wrangling-New

## Overview

The following repository will contain the projects that I did for my Data Wrangling class, QBS 181. I have received the permission of my instructor to publish this code.

## Descriptions

Homework One:
The data was stored in a database. It contained information on patient demographics.
The language I used was SQL.
Some of the operations I performed include:
Renaming columns
Creating categoric variables based on other levels of an existing variable.
Cutting numeric variables into categoric variables by creating class intervals.

Homework Two:

The datasets I used contained information on Patient Demographics, outcomes of Patient Phonecalls, and patient phonecall encounters. The data was stored in a database that I connected with using odbcConnect.
I had to use both SQL and R for this project. I did so using the SQLDF library in R. A few basic data wrangling operations I did include: 
Merging tables in SQL, 
Creating new categoric variables, 
Obtaining basic summary statistics on numeric variables.

Mid-term:
The data was in the form of a .csv file. It contained medical records of patients with various medical conditions.
I used both sql, using sqldf, and R for this project.
A few operations I did include:
Checking for duplicate values and incorrect datatypes.
Missing value treatment using Mean imputation and one hot encoding.
Outlier checks.
